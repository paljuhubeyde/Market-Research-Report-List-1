<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NOx Control Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) Reaction</li><li>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Reaction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The NOx control systems market primarily consists of two key technologies: Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) and Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR). SNCR involves injecting a reducing agent, typically urea or ammonia, into flue gases at high temperatures to chemically convert NOx into harmless nitrogen and water, without a catalyst. In contrast, SCR utilizes a catalyst to facilitate the reaction at lower temperatures, enhancing efficiency and reducing NOx emissions further. Both methods are critical in meeting stringent environmental regulations.</p></p>
