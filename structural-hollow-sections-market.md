<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Structural Hollow Sections Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot Formed Type</li><li>Cold Formed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The structural hollow sections market is categorized primarily into hot-formed and cold-formed types. Hot-formed sections are produced by heating steel above its recrystallization temperature, allowing for easier shaping and manipulation, resulting in thicker walls and higher strength. Conversely, cold-formed sections are shaped at room temperature, which enhances surface finish and dimensional accuracy but usually leads to thinner walls. Both types are widely used in construction and manufacturing, providing structural support and versatility in various applications.</p></p>
