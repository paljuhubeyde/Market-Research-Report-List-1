<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Emergency Transport Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-invasive Ventilator</li><li>Invasive Ventilator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Emergency Transport Fan market encompasses two primary types of ventilators: non-invasive and invasive. Non-invasive ventilators provide respiratory support without the need for intubation, utilizing methods like masks or nasal interfaces to assist breathing, making them ideal for patients requiring temporary ventilation. In contrast, invasive ventilators involve intubation, delivering air directly into the lungs through an endotracheal tube, essential for patients with severe respiratory distress. Both types are vital for emergency medical services to stabilize patients during transport.</p></p>
